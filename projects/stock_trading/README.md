# Stock Trading (Project 3)

This folder contains a clean, modular version of the stock-trading notebook.

## Structure

- `notebooks/`: Orchestration and experiments
- `stock_trading/`: Reusable code (data, envs, training, evaluation, plotting)
- `models/`: Saved models
- `reports/`: Figures/results

## Quick start

Open [projects/stock_trading/notebooks/stock_trading.ipynb](projects/stock_trading/notebooks/stock_trading.ipynb) and run the cells top‑to‑bottom.
