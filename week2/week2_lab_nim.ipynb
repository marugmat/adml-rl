    "- Perfect for tabular Q-learning (discrete, finite states)\n",

    "In this lab, you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ Learned how Q-learning applies to turn-based games\n",
    "2. ✅ Implemented the Q-learning update rule\n",
    "3. ✅ Trained agents on progressively harder Nim configurations\n",
    "4. ✅ Played interactively against your trained agents\n",
    "5. ✅ Analyzed how complexity affects learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Q-learning can discover winning strategies through trial and error\n",
    "- State space size grows exponentially with problem complexity\n",
    "- More training is needed for larger problems\n",
    "- Self-play can lead to stronger strategies than playing vs random\n",
